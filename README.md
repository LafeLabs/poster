# poster
 
 - get an account at [www.github.com](https://github.com/)
 - create a new Github repository in your account called "poster" 
 - create it with the PUBLIC DOMAIN CC0 license(Creative Commons Zero) and a README.md file
 - replace the README.md file with this document
 - create poster, save as file poster.pdf, upload to your github repo
 - make sure poster has QR code back to github repo with poster, which is at github.com/[your user name]/poster/ as well as the URL spelled out
 - print poster and distribute in physical spaces
 - link posters back to social media which you can use to interact with the replicating media
 - [download the pdf to print](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/poster/main/poster.pdf)
 - organic replication is achieved when the Github repo and the physical poster are both replicating, each with new people replicating, so that the *set* including the creator, the files, and the physical media is all replicating together.
